# Hangman Node App
	In this Hangman Game we feature a classic game of HangMan inside the command line/terminal. Players will have to guess a random word from a category of NFL Team names.
## Installation
	1. Clone the git repository to your command line/terminal
	2. run an "npm install" for inquirer in the command line/terminal.
	3. Lastly run a "node main.js" command to begin playing!
## Usage
Users will have 10 guesses to spell the team name. If they fail to do so, the game is over.
